                        <li>A <b>Direct Assist</b> is the final touch (pass, cross or any other touch) leading to the

                        <li>
                          In addition to normal assists, the following types of <b>Fantasy Assists</b> will be awarded
                          to a player:
                          <ul>
                            <li>When a shot is saved by goalkeeper, blocked by the defender or hits the goal post, and
                              is scored on the rebound</li>
                            <li>When a player wins a penalty or a direct free-kick that is scored</li>
                            <li>When an opposition player scores an own goal off a cross, pass or shot</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>A <b>Chance Created</b>, also known as a 'key pass', is the final touch (pass, cross or any
                          other touch) leading to a shot, regardless of whether it is on target (including goals),
                          blocked or off target.</li>
                        <li><b>Note:</b> If a player gets points for a Fantasy Assist, they will <b>not be awarded</b>
                          points for a Chance Created. For example, if a player's shot is saved by a goalkeeper and is
                          scored on the rebound, the player will get points for a Shot on Target and Fantasy Assist, but
                          won't earn points for Chance Created.</li>
                        <li>A <b>Shot on Target</b> is any goal attempt that:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Is a goal</li>

                              player who is the last-man (with the goalkeeper having no chance of preventing the goal)
                            </li>

                        <li>
                          A shot on target in NOT awarded when:
                          <ul>
                            <li>The shot hits the goal post (unless the ball goes in and is a goal)</li>
